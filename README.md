# The Cosy Shop's Sales Analysis

### Table of Contents

### Project Overview

This data analysis project takes a retrospective look at an online store I founded in the year 2021. Through the lens of an analyst, we will time travel one last time to explore the shop's data. The purpose of this project is to uncover hidden patterns and interaction between product sold and the customer behaviour. This will then inform strategic marketing decisions and provide a deeper
understanding of the business' performance during it's operational period.

### Data Sources

The primary data for this analysis is 'Rawdata.xlsl', containing two worksheets; Products and Sales. It was intitially collected but was later refined by extending the entries to provide a more comprehensive dataset.

### Tools
In this project, I use a combination of four tools; Python, Excel, Tableau, and MySQL queries to showcase technical versatility.

- **Excel**
  - Data cleaning and Organization
  - Analysis
  - Visualization
- **Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
  - Data Preprosessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization
- **Tableau**
  - Visualization using cleaned and merged Excel data "Cleanrawdata.xlsx" file
- **MySQL**
  - I wrote SQL queries to answer some basic questions using "Rawdata.xlsx" file

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
### Exploratory Data Analysis
On top of insights here are some questions that need to be answered;

 1. What is the distribution of products sold?
 2. What are the top 10 customer locations based on sales volume?
 3. What is the average amount spent per customer location?
 4. What is the top-selling product per customer location?
 5. What was the monthly bestseller?

### Data Analysis
### Results/Findings
 Product fatigue is noticeable for every product after a while even with strategic marketing
 Clothing category seems to be performing well particulary knit wear
 Nairobi area seems to be doing well compared to other regions
 
### Recommendation

Diversify or switch up products oftenly to avoid ad and product fatigue 
Try to lean towards knit wear as they are doing well
Increase marketing campaigns in Westlands, Thika, Donholm and Kileleshwa areas as they buy and spend more
